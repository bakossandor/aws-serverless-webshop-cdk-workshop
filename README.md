# AWS Serverless Webshop Workshop
The Project aim is to showcase how to use and manage AWS resources within an Infrastructure as a Code setup, using `aws-cdk`. The product would represent a solution/proof of concept for a webshop, using CRUD operations (not more advanced concept or patterns, which would be more ideal in recent years).

The AWS Resources:
- DynamoDB
- Cognito
- API Gateway (HTTP API)
- Lambda
- Amplify
- S3
- CodeBuild
